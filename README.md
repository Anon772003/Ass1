Thanks for uploading all four files. These Java programs together implement a **simple RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** based calculator in Java. RMI allows a Java program to invoke methods that run on a remote object, meaning client and server can run on different machines.

---

### 📌 **Overview: What is the question about?**

**Task:**
Create a client-server calculator using Java RMI, where the client sends two numbers to the server, and the server performs **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division** and returns the results.

---

### 🧩 **Explanation of Each File (Program):**

---

#### **1. `ServerIntf.java` (Interface) — \[📁 severintf.txt]**

This is a remote interface that declares the methods which can be called remotely by the client.

```java
public interface ServerIntf extends Remote {
    double addition(double num1, double num2) throws RemoteException;
    double subtraction(double num1, double num2) throws RemoteException;
    double multiplication(double num1, double num2) throws RemoteException;
    double division(double num1, double num2) throws RemoteException;
}
```

📌 **Purpose:**
Defines the operations supported by the server and ensures any implementation must follow this contract.

---

#### **2. `ServerImpl.java` (Server Implementation) — \[📁 severimpl.txt]**

This is the actual implementation of the interface.

```java
public class ServerImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements ServerIntf {
    public ServerImpl() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }

    public double addition(...) { ... }
    public double subtraction(...) { ... }
    public double multiplication(...) { ... }
    public double division(...) { ... }
}
```

📌 **Purpose:**
Contains actual logic for arithmetic operations. It also handles division-by-zero safely by throwing a `RemoteException`.

---

#### **3. `Server.java` (Main server code) — \[📁 server.txt]**

This class starts the server and binds the object to the RMI registry with the name `"Calculator"`.

```java
ServerImpl obj = new ServerImpl();
Naming.rebind("Calculator", obj);
```

📌 **Purpose:**
Registers the server object in the RMI registry so clients can look it up and call methods remotely.

---

#### **4. `Client.java` — \[📁 client.txt]**

The client that connects to the server, takes input from the user, and invokes methods on the remote object.

```java
ServerIntf serverIntf = (ServerIntf) Naming.lookup("rmi://localhost/Calculator");
```

📌 **Purpose:**
Gets user input, sends it to the server, and displays results (addition, subtraction, etc.) on screen.

---

### ▶️ **How to Run These Programs**

#### ✅ **Step-by-step Instructions:**

1. **Compile all Java files:**

```bash
javac ServerIntf.java ServerImpl.java Server.java Client.java
```

2. **Start the RMI Registry in the terminal (leave it running):**

```bash
rmiregistry
```

> 🔸 *Make sure you're in the same directory where `.class` files are present when you run `rmiregistry`.*

3. **Open a new terminal and start the server:**

```bash
java Server
```

> Output: `Server is ready...`

4. **Open another terminal and run the client:**

```bash
java Client
```

> You’ll be prompted to enter two numbers. Then you’ll see the results for all four operations.

### 💡 Example Output:

```
Enter First Number: 20
Enter Second Number: 5

-----------RESULTS----------
Addition: 25.0
Subtraction: 15.0
Division: 4.0
Multiplication: 100.0
```

### 🧠 Summary

| File       | Role                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ServerIntf | Interface with method signatures       |
| ServerImpl | Implements the logic                   |
| Server     | Binds the server object                |
| Client     | Connects to server and invokes methods |

Would you like me to generate a diagram or flowchart showing how the client-server interaction works?
